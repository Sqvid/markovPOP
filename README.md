# A simple Markov chain text generator.

This is a simple implementation of a Markov chain text generator as described in
the book *The Practice of Programming* by Kernighan and Pike.

The C implementation is very similar to the one from the book, except it is C99
compliant and frees all memory. The other implementations are from scratch.

## Usage:
Pipe input from `stdin` into any of the binaries. That's it. Larger text will
produce better (but still fairly deranged) output.
